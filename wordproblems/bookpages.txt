A book has N pages, numbered the usual way, from 1 to N. The total number of digits in the page numbers is 1,095. How many pages does the book have?

--My thinking:
Misinterpreted the question as thinking of a book that counts up to page N, which itself has 1,095 digits. Then it comes across as a question of what value 1,095 digits can represent - but that's just 10^1094, because 1 digit represents 10^1 values, 2 digits 10^2, etc...

--Correct answer:
Anyway, aside from my fairly obvious mistake, we're trying to count how many digits are TOTAL in the sequence of numbers from 1 to N. Actually, we know how many digits there are, so we need to determine backwards how high you have to count to make that the case.

The first 9 pages count for 9 digits: 
page:		1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
#ofdigits:	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
total:		1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

The next 90 pages each have 2 digits:
page: 		10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
#ofdigs:	2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2
total:		11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29

etc....

So let's come up with a formula for the total number of digits.
Let f(x) be the total number of digits, where x is that page number.
f(x) =	x		} x < 10
	9 + 2*(x-9)	} x < 100
	189 + 3*(x-99)	} x < 1000
	...(etc)

We can assume that our book will not have more than 1000 pages, since we're going to have just over 1000 total digits. Therefore, let's try the third formula:

f(x) = 189 + 3*(x-99) = 1,095
3x-297 = 906
x = 401

So 401 pages should give you that number of digits total.
