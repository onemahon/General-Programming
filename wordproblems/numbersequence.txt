My answer (quicker answer):
We trust that the interviewer is being honest about it being a sequence. Given a series of numbers, there's no way to be certain as to which sequence they represent - in this case, maybe the given numbers are just the first iteration; so the next number would follow the same rule as the first->second numbers. In this case, just subtract 1 from 10 to get 9; so subtract 1 from 66, and the next number might be 65.
