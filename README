Thank you for viewing my work.

This repository is made public for two reasons:
	(1) I am learning git
	(2) It can serve as a portfolio for my code for anyone interested in what I've worked on.

Everything here is non-proprietory, but I daresay it's also fairly useless. If you have any questions about anything, feel free to message me.

Cheers,
-Joe
