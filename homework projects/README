Thanks for checking out some of my homework problems. These are some solutions to past assignments (for courses not currently offered) in my bachelor's studies.

Please be aware that many of the problems might not work correctly, or the best way; I haven't actually edited them since the time of these courses, and some of them I know to be incorrect. However, the intent is merely to document some interesting methods in the C programming language.

Perhaps this is most succinctly left to the notorious phrase, the correctness of these problems is left as an excerisize for the reader.
